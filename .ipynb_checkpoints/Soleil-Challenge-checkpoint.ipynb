    "\n",
    "What Is Phishing Email? \n",
    "\n",
    "Phishing is a form of cyberattack where attackers attempt to trick individuals and organisations into revealing sensitive information, such as login credentials or financial details, by impersonating a trustworthy entity via electronic communication, typically email. The attacker often manipulates the victim’s emotions or uses a sense of urgency to achieve their goals.\n",

    "#### **What?**\n",
    "\n",
    "*What is the main goal of this project?*\n",
    "\n",
    "I want to implement a model that will detect phishing emails automatically without human intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Why**\n",
    "*Why is this project important?*\n",
    "\n",
    "With the development of technology, emails are widely used in business, professional, and social communication. Criminals also see this as an opportunity to steal people's money or access personal information and use them in their criminal activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, not everyone is able to recognize a phishing email just by looking at it. People are still being victims of phishing emails and other online criminalities. Because of this issue, having a system that will detect phishing emails and flag them will help users of emails recognize those unwanted emails and prevent the damage this can cause to email users.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Who**\n",
    "*Who will benefit from the results of this project?*\n",
    "\n",
    "This model will benefit the following stakeholders:\n",
    " Companies/Institutions that use emails in their work or business will benefit from this system because it will protect their business and the data of their employees and clients\n",
    "Normal users of email are the main target of phishing therefore will benefit from this system.\n",
    "Email providers have the responsibility of protecting their client's data, therefore this system will be beneficial for them\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **When**\n",
    "*When will you deliver this projetc?*\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, I am using the Jira software as a tool for my planning and progress of increments. I create use stories to work on during a sprint and for each Sprint I set its goal. Below is the screenshot of my sprint.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will consist of 2 iterations of challenge 1. The masterpiece challenge will be delivered on the 26th of November.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **How**\n",
    "*How will the project achieve its objectives?* \n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, I will need the dataset to train and test my model. The data required are sample emails with their types. For Cleaning, processing, and analyzing the dataset, Python will be used as a programming language and Jupyter Notebook will be used as a development environment. \n",
    "Dataset: The dataset that will be used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle. The dataset is composed of 18650 rows and 2 columns(Email body and Email type).\n",
    "Machine Learning Algorithm: Since the expected outcome of this project is a model that will classify incoming emails, Classification will be a suitable algorithm to use in this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🟡 Data Sourcing\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Define Objectives: \n",
    "\n",
    "-To implement a machine learning model for emails that predicts whether an email is phishing or safe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Requirements: Determine the data requirements:\n",
    "- Text data: Email body.\n",
    "- Labels: Each email needs to be flagged as phishing or safe\n",
    "Data Sources: Identify potential data sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Publicly available datasets: The data is available publicly on the Kaggle website, and can be downloaded freely\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Legality and Ethics:\n",
    "- Use only publicly available data or data with appropriate licenses.\n",
    "- Data used should not contain personal details or any sensitive data\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Diversity: \n",
    "- For analyzing phishing emails, any source email provider can be used as long as it is publicly available or has an appropriate license\n",
    "\n",
    "Version Control: \n",
    "\n",
    " -GitHub will be used to track all changes that will be performed during preprocessing, this will help to revert changes as needed.\n",
    " \n",
    "Iterative Process:\n",
    "- Continuously monitor the model's performance and gather feedback.\n",
    "- If the model is not performing well, consider reevaluating and updating the data sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I have found a number of datasets from Kaggle  which will enable me to bring my challenge to a successful conclusion. The datasets are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **phishing.csv** : This dataset is  contains all the the phishing email\n",
    "- **data_extracted_easy_ham.csv** :This one contains all safe email\n",
    "\n",

    "Looking at the accuracy score we see that this model perform very well as it is predicting with 99% accuracy. We have some hyperparameters `max_features` and `ngram_range` used in the CountVectorizer that may playing a role in the performance of this model. However, myself I am not able to explain them at the moment(More reading needed). I got idea on this `Modeling` part from Prashantrajkaggle. Ref: Prashantrajkaggle. (2023, July 4).
