    "\n",

    "\n",
    "(0) class: There are 3 classes, representing the 3 different cultivars.\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Alcohol - The average glass of wine contains about 11 percent to 13 percent alcohol, but bottles range from as little as 5.5 percent ABV to as much as around 20 percent ABV (source: https://www.realsimple.com/holidays-entertaining/entertaining/food-drink/alcohol-content-wine)\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Malic acid: It is a kind of acid with strong acidity and apple aroma. The red wine is naturally accompanied by malic acid. \n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Ash: The essence of ash is an inorganic salt, which has an effect on the overall flavor of the wine and can give the wine a fresh feeling. \n",
    "\n",
    "(4) Alkalinity of ash: It is a measure of weak alkalinity dissolved in water.\n",
    "\n",
    "(5) Magnesium: It is an essential element of the human body, which can promote energy metabolism and is weakly alkaline.\n",
    "\n",
    "(6) Total phenols: molecules containing polyphenolic substances, which have a bitter taste and affect the taste, color and taste of the wine, and belong to the nutrients in the wine.\n",
    "\n",
    "(7) Flavanoids: It is a beneficial antioxidant for the heart and anti-aging, rich in aroma and bitter.\n",
    "\n",
    "(8) Nonflavanoid phenols: It is a special aromatic gas with oxidation resistance and is weakly acidic. \n",
    "\n",
    "(9) Proanthocyanins: It is a bioflavonoid compound, which is also a natural antioxidant with a slight bitter smell. \n",
    "\n",
    "(10) Color intensity: refers to the degree of color shade. It is used to measure the style of wine to be “light” or “thick”. The color intensity is high, meanwhile the longer the wine and grape juice are in contact during the wine making process, the thicker the taste.\n",
    "\n",
    "(11) Hue: refers to the vividness of the color and the degree of warmth and coldness. It can be used to measure the variety and age of the wine. Red wines with higher ages will have a yellow hue and increased transparency. Color intensity and hue are important indicators for evaluating the quality of a wine's appearance.\n",
    "\n",
    "(12) OD280/OD315 of diluted wines: This is a method for determining the protein concentration, which can determine the protein content of various wines.\n",
    "\n",
    "(13) Proline: It is the main amino acid in red wine and an important part of the nutrition and flavor of wine."
